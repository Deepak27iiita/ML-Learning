# NumpPandas

This folder contains NumPy and Pandas practice notebooks for the ML-Learning course.

Notebooks

- `numpyassignments.ipynb` — NumPy practice assignments.
- `numpysolutions.ipynb` — Solutions for NumPy assignments (examples and working code snippets).
- `pandasasssignments.ipynb` — Pandas practice assignments.
- `pandassolution.ipynb` — Solutions for Pandas assignments.

How to use

1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code (with the Python extension).
2. Use a Python environment with NumPy and Pandas installed. Example install:

```powershell
pip install numpy pandas
```

Notes

- Notebooks contain exercises and partial solutions; run each code cell in order.
- If you want, I can also add a `requirements.txt` or a small `environment.yml` for reproducibility.
